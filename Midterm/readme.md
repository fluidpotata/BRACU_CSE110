<b> Question-01 </b>


The freshers are confused about the room number format of BRACU. The couldn't find out their room numbers from the given information. 
You are given the responsibility to write a program that will differentiate the building number, floor number and room number. 
You will be given a room number with a format where first 2 letters will represent University Building, next letter will represent building number, 
next 2 letters will represent floor number and next 2 numbers will represent room number.


====================================================


**Sample input:** </br>
UB20801

**Sample output:**</br>
Building: 2</br>
Floor : 8</br>
Room: 1</br>


**Question-02**


Your little brother is trying to learn counting and vowel-consonent. And constantly bothering you with it. 
You have mid terms ongoing. So you write a code that will take a string as a input and provide count of vowel, 
consonant numerics and other characters.
Write the code now. You cannot use 'list' data type.


====================================================

**Sample input:**</br>
Amar Son@r Bangla 1971</br>

**Sample output:**</br>
Vowel : 5</br>
Consonant: 9</br>
Numbers: 4</br>
Other : 1</br>

**Question-03**

Write a python program that takes 2 inputs from the user.</br>
-The two inputs cannot be the same integers.</br>
-Find the minimum and maximum among the two user inputs. The minimum will 
be the start of the range and the maximum will be the end of the range 
(inclusive). Print the series of even numbers. </br>
-Take the last number from the series of even numbers and check whether it 
is divisible by the rest of the even numbers of that series. Finally, print 
the divisors for that number.</br>

Note: If the user inputs the same integer in the second input, 
print "Invalid input" and end the program. If the series of even numbers 
consist of 0, then 0 will be skipped and not be considered as a divisor.

====================================================

Sample input 1:</br>
-4</br>
18</br>

Sample Output 1:</br>
The even numbers within the range: -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18</br>
The divisors of 18 are: -2, 2, 6, 18</br>
