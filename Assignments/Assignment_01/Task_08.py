'''Task 8
Write the Python code of a program that reads an integer, and prints the integer if it is a multiple of 2 AND 5 and prints "Not multiple of 2 and 5 both" otherwise.
==========================================================
For example, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 â€¦ i.e. this only includes numbers which are multiples of both 2 and 5.
hint(1): we may use the modulus (%) operator for checking the divisibility
hint(2): we can consider the number to be an integer
==========================================================
Sample Input 1:
30
Sample Output 1:
30
==========================================================
Sample Input 2:
15
Sample Output 2:
Not multiple of 2 and 5 both'''

num = int(input("Please enter the number: "))
if num%2==0 and num%5==0:
    print(num)
else:
    print("Not multiple of 2 and 5 both")
